# Task Planner App

This web app is designed to help you manage your day-to-day tasks better by providing a simple and intuitive task planner. You can easily create, modify, and track you daily tasks here and get data visualizations of your progress. In case, you're feeling bogged down with all the work, it also includes daily motivation quotes to help you push through the day.

### Technologies Used
- Flask (app routing, login/signup, template rendering, etc)
- JWT (user authentication, secure sessions)
- SQLAlchemy (Storing User and Task data)
- Bootstrap/HTML (user interface, input forms, etc)
- Jinja (dynamic content, validation)


### Hows it works
Users must have a account first to get started with the app. Once created, they will be directed to the homepage where they can view a list of upcoming and high priority tasks along with visuals of their current progress. The user can navigate to the create tab to add news tasks with specific labels for easier filtering afterwards. The task list contains all the currently active tasks and users can edit/remove the tasks from there directly as needed.
